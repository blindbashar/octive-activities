This repository holds a collection of stand-alone WebGL widgets, generally consisting of one pair of HTML and JS files each.

The intent behind their design is to provide small, interactive experiences that can be embedded on any webpage to add flavor.

These are not "games," because they have no score and no win or lose condition. The only goal is entertainment and relaxation.

Feel free to use this code for any purpose (CC0.)

Cheers. - Theo
