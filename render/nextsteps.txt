Next Steps & Improvements (Key Expansions)

    Transformations (Matrices):
        Introduce uniform variables in the vertex shader to pass in transformation matrices (model, view, projection). This will allow you to move, rotate, and scale objects, and to control the camera position. You'll need a JavaScript library for matrix math (e.g., glMatrix).

    Depth Testing:
        Enable depth testing (gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST)) to ensure objects are drawn in the correct order (closer objects occlude farther objects). Make sure to clear the depth buffer (gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) in your drawScene function.

    Animation:
        Use requestAnimationFrame() to create a render loop. This will continuously call your drawScene function, allowing you to update transformations and create animations.

    User Input:
        Add event listeners (e.g., for mouse clicks, keyboard presses) to interact with the scene.

    More Complex Geometry:
        Load 3D models from external files (e.g., .obj, .gltf). This involves parsing the file format and creating appropriate buffers.

    Textures:
        Apply textures to your objects to make them look more realistic. This involves creating texture objects, loading image data, and setting up texture coordinates in your vertex data.

    Lighting:
        Implement lighting calculations (e.g., Phong shading) in your shaders to simulate how light interacts with surfaces.

    Widgetization:
        Wrap the rendering logic inside a reusable JavaScript class or component. This will make it easy to integrate the renderer into other projects.
        Add parameters to control aspects of the renderer (e.g., background color, camera position, object color).

    Error Handling:
        Make sure your error handling and logging during shader compile/link, and buffer upload, is robust.

This detailed breakdown should give you a solid foundation for building your WebGL 3D renderer widget. Remember to start simple and gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the concepts. Good luck!
